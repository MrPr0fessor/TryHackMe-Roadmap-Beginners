# Getting Started with Hacking on TryHackMe
***Mehmood Ali*** 

# Introduction:

Step into the realm of cybersecurity! In the modern digital environment, gaining hands-on skills is essential for thriving in this field. TryHackMe, a widely recognized online platform, offers an immersive, practical learning experience for those who aspire to be cybersecurity experts. This article is here to assist newcomers on their TryHackMe journey, presenting a structured route to gain foundational knowledge and practical proficiency.

# Roadmap Overview:

The TryHackMe pathway is created with the intention of gradually familiarizing novices with a range of cybersecurity elements, starting from fundamental ideas and advancing to more complex methods. It is divided into numerous segments, with each one dedicated to distinct domains and skill areas. Now, let's take a quick look at each of these sections.

## Intro Rooms:

The initial segment acquaints newcomers with TryHackMe's platform, providing guidance on platform navigation, setting up OpenVPN, and commencing the journey into cybersecurity education.

## Linux and Windows Fundamentals:

These segments establish a strong base of understanding in the fundamentals of operating systems, with a focus on Linux and Windows environments. You'll acquire vital knowledge of commands, file systems, permissions, and basic scripting, equipping you with the skills needed to efficiently operate and navigate within these systems.

## Basics Rooms:

The Foundational Rooms section delves further into the core principles of cybersecurity, addressing subjects like penetration testing, security principles, hacker approaches, and physical security. These rooms provide hands-on exercises to enhance critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.

## Recon:

Within the Reconnaissance segment, you'll delve into the craft of gathering information, encompassing both passive and active methods, content discovery, and open-source intelligence (OSINT). This expertise plays a pivotal role in collecting data and gaining insights into potential targets.

## Scripting:

Scripting proves to be an essential skill for task automation and tool development. This segment encompasses scripting languages such as Python, JavaScript, and Bash, offering a robust basis for crafting your security scripts and proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits.

## Networking:

Comprehending networking principles is a fundamental requirement for every cybersecurity expert. This segment presents the fundamentals of networking, including subjects like protocols, local area networks (LAN), HTTP, DNS, and network scanning. It will provide you with a deeper understanding of network functioning and the ability to spot vulnerabilities.

## Tooling:

The Tools section concentrates on a range of instruments employed in the realm of cybersecurity. You'll delve into well-known utilities such as Metasploit, Nmap, Burp Suite, Wireshark, and others. Proficiency in these tools and their capabilities is essential for carrying out efficient security assessments.

## Crypto & Hashes:

Cryptography and hashing are pivotal for ensuring secure communication and data integrity. In this segment, you'll delve into encryption algorithms, deciphering hashed data, and tackling cryptographic puzzles, thereby enriching your grasp of cryptographic principles.

## Steganography:

Steganography involves concealing data within files that appear unassuming. Within this segment, you'll acquire skills to reveal and extract concealed information from images, audio, and various forms of digital media.

## Web:

The Web segment is specifically designed for web application security. It encompasses subjects like web vulnerabilities, the OWASP Top 10, the exploitation of web applications, and the utilization of tools like Burp Suite, SQLMap, and others. You will acquire hands-on experience in identifying and capitalizing on weaknesses in web applications.
